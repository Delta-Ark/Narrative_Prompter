# Narrative_Prompter
This scipt analyzes input (e.g. the term "gun" or "love") and prompts the user with common sense relations (e.g. "used for killing" or "causes relationship"); the user can search for general or specific relations.

1. place file on desktop
2. enter python
3. type python auto_c_nar.py
4. search a term, let's try "love"
5. how many relations do you want? if you're looking specific relations, I suggest 1000; if you're looking for
general relations I suggest 200
6. let's first try general, so just type general
7. "love is related to eros"
8. so when it says "select" I'll add: "they were feeling erotic" to my narrative.
9. when it asked for the term, I'm going to say "eros" (so that we're building a narrative chain)
10. I'll put in a 1000 bc I'm looking for a specific relation
11. I put "RelatedTo" so that I know what else they were feeling.
12. "libido related to eros" and so forth and so on.
13. I could search for "cause of eros" but I'm not going to go there; you get the picture.
